# MoneyDexter -a book-keeping app

<p> This is a book keeping app that I have been working on for the past week, there's still a lot to implement and I am currently working
on it while balancing school to make it functionable. The app was written in Kotlin using Android Studio.
      - ***Adding/Deleting Transactions\n
      - ***Calculating Daily/Monthly/Yearly expenditure\n
      - **Budget Planning for the weeks/month\n
      - *Able to calculate transactions from receipts\n
      - ***Able to prioritize important payments and bills over consumption costs\n
      - Use Kotlin to enable iOS support\n
