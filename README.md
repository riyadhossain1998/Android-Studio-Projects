# MoneyDexter -a book-keeping app

<p> This is a book keeping app that I have been working on for the past week, there's still a lot to implement and I am currently working
on it while balancing school to make it functionable. The app was written in Kotlin using Android Studio. </p>

      <p> - *Able to calculate transactions from receipts </p>
      <p> - ***Able to prioritize important payments and bills over consumption costs </p>
